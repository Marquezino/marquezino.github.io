## Prospective Students

Admissions to the Master’s and PhD programs at COPPE/UFRJ are conducted exclusively through the official selection process available [in the selection page](https://pesc.coppe.ufrj.br/selecao/?page_id=262&lang=en). I will be glad to clarify questions by email; however, applications are not handled through direct contact with faculty members.

I am always interested in working with highly motivated students whose research interests align with my areas of study. If you apply to the PESC/COPPE graduate program and indicate your interest in conducting research in Algorithms and Combinatorics, your application may be evaluated within the regular selection process.

Detailed information regarding procedures, requirements, and deadlines can be found on the official COPPE/PESC admissions page. Admissions occur on a quarterly basis, and prospective applicants are encouraged to pay close attention to deadlines.

Undergraduate students interested in research activities, including Scientific Initiation projects, are welcome to contact me directly.

International students should check [https://internacional.ufrj.br/en/international-relations/].

## Postdoctoral Researchers

Researchers interested in postdoctoral opportunities are encouraged to get in touch to discuss potential projects and funding possibilities. Collaborations aligned with my research themes are always welcome.
