My research lies at the intersection of theoretical Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, and quantum computation. Broadly, my work seeks to understand how the structural properties of computational problems interact with the dynamical and physical principles underlying computation.

A central theme of my research is the study of quantum algorithms, particularly through the framework of quantum walks. Quantum walks provide a natural bridge between algorithmic design, combinatorial structures, and quantum dynamical processes. My work investigates their algorithmic capabilities, limitations, and robustness, both in idealized theoretical models and in noise-aware settings relevant to near-term quantum technologies.

Closely related to this line of inquiry, I study quantum optimization and quantum complexity theory, exploring how quantum computational models reshape classical notions of algorithmic efficiency, problem structure, and computational hardness. These investigations often draw upon techniques from combinatorics and graph theory, reflecting the discrete mathematical foundations of many quantum algorithmic frameworks.

Another important component of my research concerns the classical simulation of quantum algorithms. Understanding when and how quantum processes can be efficiently approximated or simulated on classical computers provides valuable insight into the boundaries of quantum computational advantage.

More broadly, my work is motivated by fundamental questions about computation under physical constraints. In this context, I maintain active interest in reversible computing and related models that illuminate the relationship between information, dynamics, and computational processes.

Looking forward, I am particularly interested in expanding my research toward quantum machine learning and quantum Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, areas that naturally extend my ongoing investigations of algorithmic structure, stochastic processes, and quantum dynamics.
